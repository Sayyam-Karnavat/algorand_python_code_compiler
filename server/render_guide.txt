1. Select python as langauge
2. Use root as "server" or whatever folder you want to work or run commands from your github folder
3. In custom command use "python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install algokit"

4. If default python version(as seen in logs while deploying on render) is different then in environment variables provide
    PYTHON_VERSION = 3.12.2 ( For latest algokit libraries support)

5. Since we have installed algokit in virtual environment
    # In start command provide 
    source .venv/bin/activate && python app.python


6. Also made changes in deploy_app.py so that the compile command uses algokit from virtual environment

    command = [
        ".venv/bin/algokit", "compile", "python", temp_file_path, "--output-arc56", "--no-output-teal" ,"--out-dir" , temp_compile_directory
    ]

    # Note the ".venv/bin/algokit" usage
