/* Use media queries to optimize for different devices and screen sizes */

  /* Desktop view */
}

In this improved code, we've followed best practices for React development by using hooks and a modular CSS structure. We've also optimized the performance of the application by using media queries and reducing code repetition. Finally, we've used Tailwind to improve maintainability and reduce code size.
