Commit Message: Implemented best practices for React and CSS optimization.

Changes Made:

1. Separated component styles into a separate file. This improves code organization and makes it easier to manage large projects with many components.
2. Separated utility classes into a separate file. This allows for more modularity and reusability of the utility classes.
3. Removed unused imports. This reduces bundle size and improves performance by removing unnecessary code.
4. Renamed the `code` element selector to use a more specific selector that targets only code blocks within the application. This prevents the global styles from applying to all code elements on the page, which can cause unwanted styling issues.
5. Added a comment explaining the purpose of each file. This makes it easier for other developers to understand how the files are organized and what they contain.
6. Removed unnecessary whitespace in the `body` element selector. This improves code readability and reduces the risk of errors due to unnecessary characters.
7. Renamed the `font-family` property to use a more specific selector that targets only the `body` element. This prevents global styles from applying to all elements on the page, which can cause unwanted styling issues.
8. Removed the unused `-webkit-font-smoothing` and `-moz-osx-font-smoothing` properties in the `body` element selector. These are redundant with the `font-smooth` property and can be safely removed without any adverse effects on performance.
