```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import CodeEditor from './components/CodeEditor';
import styles from './App.module.css';

const useStyles = makeStyles({
  root: {
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});

function App() {
  const classes = useStyles();

  return (
    <div className={styles.root}>
      <CodeEditor />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
In the improved code, we've broken up the `App` component into smaller reusable components using a pattern called "component composition." This makes it easier to maintain and update the code as your application grows. We've also used CSS modules to manage our styles, which improves readability and maintainability of the code. Additionally, we've optimized the performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations for layout when the window is resized.
