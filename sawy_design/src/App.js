Commit Message: Improve code structure, CSS optimizations, and performance improvements

In this improved code, we've broken up the `App` component into smaller, more reusable components using a pattern called "component composition." This makes it easier to maintain and update the code as your application grows. We've also used CSS modules to manage our styles, which improves readability and maintainability of the code. Additionally, we've optimized the performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations for layout when the window is resized.
