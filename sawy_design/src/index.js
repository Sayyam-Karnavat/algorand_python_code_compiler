```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import Tailwind from './tailwind.css'; // Use a separate CSS file for modular styling

const root = render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

The improved code follows several best practices:

1. **Hooks**: The `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are used to manage state and side effects in the app component. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
2. **Component Structure**: The app is divided into smaller components, making it easier to understand and modify the code.
3. **Modular CSS**: The Tailwind stylesheets are separated from the React component, allowing for better code organization and reusability.
4. **Performance Optimizations**: The `useMemo` hook is used to cache expensive calculations, reducing the number of renders.
5. **Code Readability**: The improved code uses descriptive variable names and comments to make it easier to understand.
